Installation should be simple, just run docker-compose up on the root directory of the project. The application will be available on port 5000.
There should be a unique image per person, it should also be simple to reset so if someone accidentally messes up the image, they can recover the original image.
The image is setup according to the specification for these type of challenges (theoretically).

The flag can be planted in any file on the system, but it should probably be somewhat obvious since the main part of the challenge is to gain a reverse shell (that have root privileges). By default the flag is planted as a .txt file in the root directory. Can also append it somewhere fun like /etc/shadow, although that should be mentioned in the description.

To plant the flag simply uncomment the **one** of the related lines in the Dockerfile.
