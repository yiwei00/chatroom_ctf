**Introducing a New Old Chatting Service!**

In an age where every app is overburdened with useless features like an "AI" that, at the end of the day, is a reskinned chatGPT,(seriously, what is the point of the snapchat AI???) everyone just wishes apps could just cut themselves down to the bare minimum.

So taking inspirations from the good old days (rose tinted glasses? couldn't be me!) of AOL, we proudly introduce chatroom.py, a new but also very old fashioned chatting service. We cut away all the unnecessary bits of software that have somehow become "standard practice" in the last 20 years. Sending Images? Just send a thousand words (if its under 1024 characters)! GUI? No thanks! Voice Call? Overrated! With those in mind, we crafted the most minimalist and welcoming chat room you'll ever experience, all from the comforts of your terminal. No need to install anything! Everything you need can be accessed through netcat.

**Instructions**

Once the server is started at **host** and **port** you can log into the chatroom with:
> nc -v \<host\> \<port\>

Once you successfully connected, you'll be prompted to enter a username. After that, you're free to chat with everyone else. There are also server commands, enter **/help** to see a list of commands.
