[2023-04-24 19:07:16] Chatroom: bob: hello alice! thanks for showing me this app.
[2023-04-24 19:07:36] Chatroom: alice: hi bob! i'm very excited about the return of chatrooms. apparently this app uses some new python logging system called log4py, the module is suppose to be based on an older java library called log4j
[2023-04-24 19:07:46] Chatroom: bob: log4j, that sounds familiar, wasn't it on the news a while back
[2023-04-24 19:07:51] Chatroom: alice: yeah, i think it had some big vulenrability that allowed RCE
[2023-04-24 19:07:53] Chatroom: bob: hmm hopefully a similar vulenrability isn't copied over to log4py
[2023-04-24 19:08:01] Chatroom: alice: yeah that would definitely be bad wouldn't it?
[2023-04-24 19:08:11] Chatroom: bob: oh for sure, hey wanna grab a drink at the bar?
[2023-04-24 19:08:22] Chatroom: alice: sure, i'll meet you there in 5
